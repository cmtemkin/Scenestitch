export const demoScript = `The Titanic was more than a ship.
It was a symbol of human achievement and pride.

Built in Belfast, it was the largest vessel of its time.
Over 882 feet long and 175 feet tall.

The ship was designed with luxury in mind.
First-class passengers enjoyed elegant dining rooms, a swimming pool, and a gymnasium.

On April 10, 1912, Titanic departed Southampton on its maiden voyage.
More than 2,200 people were aboard, from millionaires to immigrants seeking a new life.

Four days into the journey, on a moonless night, lookouts spotted an iceberg directly ahead.
Despite efforts to turn the ship, Titanic struck the iceberg on its starboard side.

The "unsinkable" ship had met its match.
Water began flooding into the lower compartments.

As the situation became dire, the crew began loading lifeboats.
"Women and children first" was the order given.

There weren't enough lifeboats for everyone.
Many faced the grim reality that they would not survive.

At 2:20 AM on April 15, the Titanic slipped beneath the freezing waters of the North Atlantic.
More than 1,500 people perished in one of history's deadliest maritime disasters.

The tragedy changed maritime regulations forever.
Ships would now be required to carry enough lifeboats for all passengers.

Today, the Titanic rests on the ocean floor, a solemn memorial to those who were lost.
But its story continues to captivate our imagination, a powerful reminder of both human ingenuity and hubris.`;
